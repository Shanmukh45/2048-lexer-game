The Operations:
   16 Moves: Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide Left/Right/Up/Down. : Natural, except the 
      extensions due to the airthmetic operations added, and the variables assigned.
   Assignment: Assign << value >> to << x >>,<< y >>. : Setting a tile value.
   Naming: Var << varname >> is << x >>,<< y >>. : Naming a tile. Each subsequent
      move will move the name also to the destination of this tile according to merging and
      stopping results. This may result in a tile getting several names.
   Query: Value in << x >>,<< y >> : This value can be used in an assignment.
